  * Replication Logs
    * Statement-Based Logs
    * Write-Ahead Logs
    * Logical Logs (Row-Based Logs)
    * Trigger-Based Replication
  * Replication Lag/Latency
    * Read-Your-Writes
    * Monotonic Reads
    * Transactions as a Solution
* **Multi-Leader Replication**
  * Multi Leader Use Cases
    * Multi-Datacenter Operation
